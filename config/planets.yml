- Kalavari:
    Description: 'Kalavari is the royal capital, the home of the Sun King and
      surrounding court. Much of the planet is given over to the sprawling city
      which shares its name, a gleaming art-deco megalopolis home to several
      billion. Kalavari has countless public holidays and a very popular arena
      in which gladiatorial games are held, all serving to distract the public
      from the general drudgery and oppression of life in the Rājya.'
    Notable people:
      - 'The royal court is the centre of wealthy social life, with
        the big names being the members of the four clans Valentine, Wolfe, Oberoi
        and Gulzar. The clans are sprawling, complicated affairs with countless
        minor subclans sprouting from each house – Lt. Col. Silence, who you met
        in the first session, is from a minor branch of the Valentine clan. The
        monarch appoints an heir from one of the major clans, and a new monarch
        renounces all ties to their clan upon taking the throne. (The current Sun
        King was once Rhajiv Ghatak Oberoi, but clan Oberoi gets no special
        treatment these days.)'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Akhāṛā: 'Where the most spectacular of games are held, and the of
          fights. Tickets are kept deliberately cheap, so that the common folk can
          attend. The most popular fighter is the Durandal, a masked swordsman of
          great skill.'
      - The Drowned Heron: 'A slummy little bar tucked deep in the undercity.
          Home to some rather terrifying drinks specials and a curiously stocked
          holo jukebox, it’s also reputed to be a meeting place for the
          anti-royalists movement.'
- Corilia:
    Description: 'A large planet on the edge of the empire with three moons,
      Primus, Secundus and Tertius, of which Primus and Tertius support life.
      The planet itself if covered in a single, all consuming ruin of a past
      civilisation. Access to the planet is forbidden, although enforcement is
      patchy at best and a thriving trade of artifacts and trinkets scavenged
      from the surface exists on Corilia Primus and Corilia Tertius.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Corilia Primus: 'Sparsely populated and has a climate well suited to a
          fruit the locals produce alcohol from. The drink, similar to gin, is the
          system''s primary export.'
      - Corilia Secundus: 'Home to an Imperial Naval base until approx. fifty
          years ago. The local ruling class fell out of favour and naval assets were
          moved to more politically expedient climes. A group of smugglers now
          occupy the base.'
      - Corilia Tertius: 'Home to around a billion people, largely supporting
          Corilia University and the archeological teams they send to the planet''s
          surface. There have been troubles recently between archeologists and
          groups of Senders who have declared themselves the "inheritors of Corilia"
          and settled on the planet.'
- Lupa:
    Description: 'The ancestral home of the Tē, this desert world is only
      sparsely populated, with most of that population in the capital on the
      edge of the largest oasis on the planet. The Tē are a peaceful and
      co-operative race, and after their conquer by the Sun King, the lack of
      resources and low chance of uprising meant the planet was mostly left to
      its own devices.'
    Notable people:
      - 'Lupa is a word with few travellers across it, most citizens staying in
        the town they were born in. However, there is a rumour of a traveller who
        brings water to the thirsty and lends aid to the needy - Inaama. This
        person, if they exist, is also said to control all smuggling on the planet.'
      - 'Goverment of the cities is done consistently in the same, traditional
        manner. Every 50 years a leader, or Puno, is selected at random from the
        working population, to lead and direct the civilisation. This role has no
        glamour to it, but is considered an honourable duty.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Basa: 'The main city of Lupa. Upwards of a million Tē live here, making
          this a roiling metropolis in modern terms. As with all cities on the
          planet it is next to an oasis, with convenient trade routes provided by
          the nearby canyons. It is rumoured that underneath Basa is a great
          treasure, but ground scans have indicated nothing more than aquifers.
          Given the planet''s arid nature, these are believed to be the source of
          the myth.'
- Paradise:
    Description: 'A resort planet, a luxury destination for wealthy and
      influential Senders. Its shining beaches, temperate weather and exotic
      jungles required only mild terraforming to draw customers from across the
      galaxy to relax and enjoy themselves. Paradise''s luxurious resorts are
      staffed almost entirely by Omiri, a diminutive species of six-limbed
      primates who are in fashion as servants. Large portions of the jungle have
      been cleared and replanted to make them habitable for the Omiri, who
      prefer a more arid climate.'
    Notable people:
      - 'The sentient natives of Paradise, the Ss''ur, are
        reptilian, and call the planet Ahh''ssst. They have never been in fashion
        as servants, and their hunting culture is increasingly unviable as more
        and more of the planet''s ecosystem is repurposed for Sender leisure.'
- Khō Gayā:
    Description: 'A rebel planet which has managed to resist the Rajya''s
      attempts at control so far. Populated by renegade espers, criminals,
      bounty hunters, deserters, and revolutionaries, Khō Gayā is a harsh place
      with bitterly cold and miserable weather. The espers maintain a
      telekenetic shield around the planet to protect it from Royal attack,
      though rumour has it that the Sun King''s forces are working on ways to
      circumvent this.'
    Notable people:
      - 'Lazarus D''ark, Professional Rebel. Once the official Enemy of the
        Rajya, until the rogue AIs became a greater threat. Has led countless
        rebellions, and though he''s always lost eventually he won enough to
        become something of a legend. Betrayed, arrested and tortured by the
        secret police, fled to Khō Gayā after escaping.'
      - 'Sapphire Voyage. A formidable bounty hunter with a famous bloodlust.
        Frequent partner in crime of D''ark.'
- Ānsū:
    Description: 'A galactic Leprosarium, the landmasses of which are covered
      with red plants. A constant rainfall covers most of the planet with
      complex underground caverns holding most of the water before it evaporates
      back into the atmosphere. Random data from the archive: Rumours persist
      of something called the "Red Brain", though specifics of who or what it is
      are scarce.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Merrowmont: 'The largest colony on the planet. The sufferers are tended
          to by an enigmatic sect of monks who turn away almost all visitors to
          the planet.'
- Hakeldama:
    Description: 'A pleasure planet, a planet-wide theme park. Hakeldama used
      robots to recreate a popular range of children''s entertainment, allowing
      their wealthy clientele to live among the characters of their youths.
      Quarantined 13 years ago following an unknown incident, possibly involving
      the rogue AIs.'
    Notable people:
      - 'A Royal Navy Rear Admiral, Shannon Harker, crashed her dreadnought on
        Hakeldama several years ago. Harker and her crew have not been heard from
        since and are believed dead.'
- Udyōga IV:
    Description: 'A techno-industrial world, one of the key manufacturing
      centres of the Rajya. The surface has entirely vanished beneath
      interlocking factories. Clan Gulzar has responsibility for the world and
      its output.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Facility 17: 'A secure R&D site used for the development of cutting edge
          starship weapons. It is possibly one of the most heavily guarded places
          outside of the Sun King''s palace.'
- Jotun:
    Description: 'A small, mountainous planet on the edge of its habitable zone
      mostly covered in an acrid fog. Small patches of land at the top of the
      highest mountains peek above the fog. Jotun is occupied by an intelligent
      vaguely humanoid race called the Jotnar and a species of giant aracnids
      called the Risar. The Jotnar are willing subjects of the Sun King,
      believing the Senders to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophesy
      regarding the Risar. The Risar are notable because despite lacking
      intelligence of thier own, they repeat the contents of any telepathic
      messages in the vicinity. Attempts at removing the Risar from Jotun have
      proven unsuccessful.'
    Notable people:
      - 'The Jotnar are organised into groups of no more than three thousand
        and choose their leaders each lunar month by random ballot. The Rajya have
        installed "advisors" to each of these groups who monitor them for
        insurrection.'
      - 'Jotun has several Sender built holiday resorts popular with high
        ranking senders and their families. It is not uncommon to find naval
        officers, politicians and diplomats in these resorts.'
- Celbon 2-A:
    Description: 'C2A was once a tranquil garden planet, beloved by naturalists
      and space-bird watchers. About 50 years ago the first festical was
      announced on C2A, a quiet, folksy affair to appeal to space-hippies.
      Since then the number of festivals, parties and all ou benders has
      turned the entire planet into a destination for students and stoners.
      Acts are brought in from all over the galaxy to perform meaning that
      there is never a moment where C2A falls quiet. A sprawling system of
      underground trains and travellators links the planet together.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Mount Celbonulon: 'Not actually that tall, but most of the terrain is
          flat so it towers in comparison. Home to some of the only truly
          permanent buildings including central security and the first aid station
          (which is now bigger than most centralised hospitals).'
      - Xlaterollapalooze: 'The largest festival on the planet, covers over
          200km^2. The ground is a constant carpet of yellow plastic cups and
          paper plates. Chances are that the largest acts in the galaxy are
          playing there at any one time.'
      - Celabon 345: 'The first stage to be established on the planet.
          Abandoned after the death of "Radiometric Silence" onstage during a
          performance. The area is entirely overrun by wildlife, every year a few
          crazed fans will sneak in to see where Ip, Ap and Op bit the dust.'
    Notable people:
      - 'Mr. Glideol is owner of over 70% of the planet''s land and renowned
        recluse. There are many theories about just who, and where, Glideol is.
        Every few years someone will claim to have caught him on camera
        backstage, but the photos themselves never emerge. Most people think he
        lives in an underground bunker beneath Mt. Celbonulon and makes money by
        blackmailing the bands he hires.'
      - 'Crazy Leffie is a sender who claims to have come to C2A for the first
        festival and never left. Certainly looks like heís been living off of
        food truck pizza and synthahol for half a century. Knows C2A better than
        anyone.'
- Cuitzanlo:
    Description: "Top Secret | Level 16 Access Only | Report by Dr. Inrol
      Rendaya [Deceased] |

      Cuitzanlo was discovered in [REDACTED] hidden within
      the orbit of the binary star system Freintis. Discovered by [REDACTED]
      after their onboard computer missed a decimal point whilst calculating
      warp coordinates. The planet is small with a radius only a little over
      12km. Over [REDACTED] of the surface is ocean, most of the landmass is
      found around the equator. This combined with an oxygen rich atmosphere has
      led to a predominant rainforest environment. Several small islands to the
      North are mostly arid and appear to be uninhabited. Due to its dominant
      species Cuitzanlo has been under the protection of the Raj since its
      discovery. Scramblers kept in orbit prevent anything from warping into the
      vicinity and laser stations evaporate any unauthorised artefacts from
      entering or leaving the atmosphere. There are several small villages
      scattered through the habitable areas, there are two major cities, each on
      opposite sides of the planet. The Nomhuatl are the obvious dominant
      species of the planet. They are roughly senderoid but tend to be shorter
      and slighter. Their eyes tend to be larger in order for them to navigate
      more easily through the dark forest. Their digits also tend to be longer
      than that of an average sender. There seems to be little sexual dimorphism
      in the species and they seemed unfamiliar with the concept. Their skins
      are usually a mottled green-brown, but their unique skill sets means that
      this is subject to change. |

      Co-ordinates | [REDACTED].867, [REDACTED].393, [REDACTED].542"
    Noteworthy places:
      - Przlincos: 'The city is built entirely from natural materials, wood,
          vines, and grass. The city is the living centre for the Nomhuatl. The
          centre of the city sits on a platform made out of clay bricks which are
          constantly replaces and maintained. Small figures of various deities made
          from the same clay can be found scattered through the city. There are no
          prestige houses, all the Nomhuatl live in large communal halls around the
          platform whist the centre seems to act as a marketplace and religious
          centre.'
      - Ombelliferae: 'Opposite to Przlincos. Ombelliferae is a city made
          entirely of stone, most brought from the coast and the Northern islands.
          The city is a mirror of Przlincos. However, the platform in the centre of
          the city holds a single stone mausoleum which is constantly being expanded
          by the inhabitants. All the residents of Ombelliferae are close to death;
          the old, the sick and the injured. They leave their homes weeks, months,
          sometimes years earlier to make the journey to this final resting place.'
    Notable people:
      - 'Petzol appears to be an honorary title, a single healthy member of the
        society from Przlincos is left to tend to the dead and dying in
        Ombelliferae. When a Petzol dies another takes on both their appearance
        and their title.'
      - 'Tauxi is another  honorary title passed down in the same nature as the
        Petzol. A sort of spiritual leader, they appear to have the final say in
        all disputes. The position has been held by a Raj sympathiser for over
        50 years.'
