- Kalavari:
    Description: 'Kalavari is the royal capital, the home of the Sun King and
      surrounding court. Much of the planet is given over to the sprawling city
      which shares its name, a gleaming art-deco megalopolis home to several
      billion. Kalavari has countless public holidays and a very popular arena
      in which gladiatorial games are held, all serving to distract the public
      from the general drudgery and oppression of life in the Rājya.'
    Notable people:
      - 'The royal court is the centre of wealthy social life, with
      the big names being the members of the four clans Valentine, Wolfe, Oberoi
      and Gulzar. The clans are sprawling, complicated affairs with countless
      minor subclans sprouting from each house – Lt. Col. Silence, who you met
      in the first session, is from a minor branch of the Valentine clan.  The
      monarch appoints an heir from one of the major clans, and a new monarch
      renounces all ties to their clan upon taking the throne. (The current Sun
      King was once Rhajiv Ghatak Oberoi, but clan Oberoi gets no special
      treatment these days.)'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Akhāṛā: 'Where the most spectacular of games are held, and the of
        fights. Tickets are kept deliberately cheap, so that the common folk can
        attend. The most popular fighter is the Durandal, a masked swordsman of
        great skill.'
      - The Drowned Heron: 'A slummy little bar tucked deep in the undercity.
        Home to some rather terrifying drinks specials and a curiously stocked
        holo jukebox, it’s also reputed to be a meeting place for the
        anti-royalists movement.'
- Corilia:
    Description: 'A large planet on the edge of the empire with three moons,
      Primus, Secundus and Tertius, of which Primus and Tertius support life.
      The planet itself if covered in a single, all consuming ruin of a past
      civilisation. Access to the planet is forbidden, although enforcement is
      patchy at best and a thriving trade of artifacts and trinkets scavenged
      from the surface exists on Corilia Primus and Corilia Tertius.'
    Noteworthy places:
      - Corilia Primus: 'Sparsely populated and has a climate well suited to a
      fruit the locals produce alcohol from. The drink, similar to gin, is the
      system''s primary export.'
      - Corilia Secundus: 'Home to an Imperial Naval base until approx. fifty
      years ago. The local ruling class fell out of favour and naval assets were
      moved to more politically expedient climes. A group of smugglers now
      occupy the base.'
      - Corilia Tertius: 'Home to around a billion people, largely supporting
      Corilia University and the archeological teams they send to the planet''s
      surface. There have been troubles recently between archeologists and
      groups of Senders who have declared themselves the "inheritors of Corilia"
      and settled on the planet.'
